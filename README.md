# Swale and Trench Placement Optimizer
This project automatically identifies optimal locations for trenches and swales on farmlands based on elevation and topography data. The goal is to improve irrigation, prevent water runoff, and minimize flooding by analyzing the contour lines of the land.

**Features :-**

- **Automated Placement:** Automatically suggests the best places to construct trenches and swales based on topography.
- **Elevation Data Input:** Uses CSV files containing easting, northing, elevation, and distance to analyze the landscape.
- **Visualization:** Creates contour maps using Folium and marks suggested locations for swales and trenches.
- **Efficient Design:** Helps farmers plan effective water management systems with minimal effort.

**How It Works :-**

- **Input:** Elevation and topography data from a CSV file.
- **Processing:** The app analyzes the contour lines to determine where water would naturally flow and accumulate.
- **Output:** A map showing the optimal locations for swales and trenches to improve irrigation and prevent erosion.

**Input Data Format :-**

Your CSV file should contain the following columns:

- Easting: The easting coordinate of the point.
- Northing: The northing coordinate of the point.
- Elevation: The elevation of the point.
- Distance: The distance between consecutive points (optional).

**Output :-**

The program generates a contour map with marked locations for the swales and trenches. This map can be further customized as per the requirements.

**File Structure :-**

- app.py: The main script for processing the data and generating the map.
- model.py: The file containing the logic for determining swale and trench placement.
- Site Limits.csv: Sample topography data used for testing.
